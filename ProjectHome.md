# LTE-Sim overview #

LTE-Sim is an open source framework to simulate LTE networks.

It encompasses several aspects of LTE networks, including both the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRAN) and the Evolved Packet System (EPS). It supports single and multi-cell environments, QoS management, multi users environment, user mobility, handover procedures, and frequency reuse techniques. Three kinds of network nodes are modeled: user equipment (UE), evolved Node B (eNB) and Mobility Management Entity/Gateway (MME/GW). Four different traffic generators at the application layer have been implemented and the management of data radio bearer is supported. Finally, well-known scheduling strategies (such as Proportional Fair, Modified Largest Weighted Delay First, and Exponential Proportional Fair), AMC scheme, Channel Quality Indicator feedback, frequency reuse techniques, and models for physical layer have been developed.
